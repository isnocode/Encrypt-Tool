# Encrypt-Tool
Encrypt Tool - using Visual Basic
- The software will not save the password when encrypting, instead it will check the strMD5 if it matches the original data or not.
- That's why it's impossible to recover the password when you forget it. You always need to save the password or just remember it.
- To use, you just need to drag and drop the file into the "File Path" box, then enter the password and you're done.
- The program will automatically identify the file that needs to be encrypted or decrypted to execute the command.
- This will be a great way to Encrypt/Decrypt your data.
